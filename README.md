### Important Notice:
This README.md is not yet finished. Just wait until i have time to write something pleasing, captivating and creative.
I have some ideas to implement though, and if i really have the time, i could try mixing in some code to do an updateable readme file.

Anyways, i'm leaving an edit of a photo i took at the beach, supposed to be a fictional cover of a "vaporwave/synthwave-ish" album. Just so it doesn't feel so empty. Please appreciate.
